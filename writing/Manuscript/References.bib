abstract = {Summary
Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.}

abstract = {Summary
The Cancer Genome Atlas Network recently cataloged recurrent genomic abnormalities in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We describe a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of GBM into Proneural, Neural, Classical, and Mesenchymal subtypes and integrate multidimensional genomic data to establish patterns of somatic mutations and DNA copy number. Aberrations and gene expression of EGFR, NF1, and PDGFRA/IDH1 each define the Classical, Mesenchymal, and Proneural subtypes, respectively. Gene signatures of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages. Additionally, response to aggressive therapy differs by subtype, with the greatest benefit in the Classical subtype and no benefit in the Proneural subtype. We provide a framework that unifies transcriptomic and genomic dimensions for GBM molecular stratification with important implications for future studies.}

	abstract = {Background Phenotypic heterogeneity of melanoma cells contributes to drug tolerance, increased metastasis, and immune evasion in patients with progressive disease. Diverse mechanisms have been individually reported to shape extensive intra-tumor and inter-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity, such as IFNγ signaling and proliferative to invasive transition, but how their crosstalk impacts tumor progression remains largely elusive.Methods Here, we integrate dynamical systems modeling with transcriptomic data analysis at bulk and single-cell levels to investigate underlying mechanisms behind phenotypic heterogeneity in melanoma and its impact on adaptation to targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. We construct a minimal core regulatory network involving transcription factors implicated in this process and identify the multiple {\textquoteleft}attractors{\textquoteright} in the phenotypic landscape enabled by this network. Our model predictions about synergistic control of PD-L1 by IFNγ signaling and proliferative to invasive transition were validated experimentally in three melanoma cell lines{\textemdash}MALME3, SK-MEL-5 and A375.Results We demonstrate that the emergent dynamics of our regulatory network comprising MITF, SOX10, SOX9, JUN and ZEB1 can recapitulate experimental observations about the co-existence of diverse phenotypes (proliferative, neural crest-like, invasive) and reversible cell-state transitions among them, including in response to targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These phenotypes have varied levels of PD-L1, driving heterogeneity in immunosuppression. This heterogeneity in PD-L1 can be aggravated by combinatorial dynamics of these regulators with IFNγ signaling. Our model predictions about changes in proliferative to invasive transition and PD-L1 levels as melanoma cells evade targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors were validated in multiple RNA-seq data sets from in vitro and in vivo experiments.Conclusion Our calibrated dynamical model offers a platform to test combinatorial therapies and provide rational avenues for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This improved understanding of crosstalk among PD-L1 expression, proliferative to invasive transition and IFNγ signaling can be leveraged to improve the clinical management of therapy-resistant and metastatic melanoma.All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as online supplemental information.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in the fight against cancer. In particular, in the case of glioblastoma, the most lethal brain tumour, resistance to temozolomide (the standard of care drug for chemotherapy in this tumour), is one of the main reasons behind treatment failure and hence responsible for the poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with this disease. In this paper, we combine the power of three-dimensional in vitro experiments of treated glioblastoma spheroids with mathematical models of tumour evolution and adaptation. We use a novel approach based on internal variables for modelling the acquisition of resistance to temozolomide that is observed in a group of treated spheroids in the experiments. These internal variables describe the cell{\textquoteright}s phenotypic state, which depends on the history of drug exposure and affects cell behaviour. We use model selection to determine the most parsimonious model and calibrate it to reproduce the experimental data, obtaining a high level of agreement between the in vitro and in silico outcomes. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of each model parameter in the predictions. More importantly, we show the utility of our model for answering biological questions, such as what is the intrinsic adaptation mechanism, or for separating the sensitive and resistant populations. We conclude that the proposed in silico framework, in combination with experiments, can be useful to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance in glioblastoma and to eventually set some guidelines for the design of new treatment schemes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
